Hi,

My name is Harsh. Different people call me by different names; some say Bunny, some say Avi, but most people call me crazy!

I completed my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from IIT BHU Varanasi. My stay and journey at Varanasi was one of the most beautiful experience I could ever have or gather in my lifetime! I started living in a place where people decide to die! Kashi :)

By profession, I am a researcher and an entrepreneur in making. I work in the field of Robotics and Machine Learning, trying to make machines intelligent, and contributing my teeny-tiny bit to the cognitive shift that seems to occur in the upcoming era. For my professional interests, have a look at my LinkedIn Profile.

Feel free to conatct me if you have anything in mind that you feel is worth sharing and can have a larger impact on the universe! One of my all time favourite quote is:
